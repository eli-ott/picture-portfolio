        <h3><span class="who">Who</span> am I ?</h3>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Eliott. I'm a film photographer for
          <span id="years"></span> years now. I've started photography when I
          retrieved my grandfather's camera. <br />
          Since then I got more and more into photography, learned about angles,
          lightning and more. Now I have 3 camera and all serves its own
          purpose. <br />
          I personnaly like architectures and art, and I think it sometimes
          helps me to get the perfect shot. <br />
          I also like experimenting with my pictures, trying new things that
          could be unconventional.
        </p>

      <div class="paragraph motives">
        <h3><span class="why">Why</span> photography ?</h3>
        <p>
          The thing that I love about photography is how easy it is to interpret
          the same pictures in multiple ways. Everyone will have its own
          interpretation depending on its life and experiences. <br />
          Moreover, I like to see the smallest things in life that makes it
          beautiful. And with photography I can focus on them and make them big
          things with a huge importance. <br />
          I think photography helps me showing how I view the earth and the
          vision I have of it.

          <p>
            That was my very first camera and my
            <span class="stressed">grandfather's camera</span>. It's pretty
            visible, but it still works perfectly. <br />
            I use it when photographing a
            <span class="stressed">nature or urban</span> environment that could
            potentially be far away. But I'm still using it for more common
            pictures. <br />

          <p>
            This camera was a
            <span class="stressed">gift from my brother</span>. It's very easy
            to use because it's semi-automatic, it tells you if your picture
            will be overexposed or underexposed, then you just change the
            settings. <br />
            I usually take city picture with color film with this camera.
            Because of its close range of lenses its perfect for
            <span class="stressed">inner city</span> pictures. <br />
            <br />
            <u>Camera</u> : Yashica Electro 35 G <br />

          <p>
            This camera was a <span class="stressed">gift from a friend</span>.
            I really like this one because it has a lot of details in it that
            makes your like easier. And its my only reflex camera wich makes it
            even more convenient. <br />
            I shoot <span class="stressed">moving object or portrait</span> with
            it because its so easy too change lenses and have the angle you need
            when you need it. <br />
